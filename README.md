# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-Project

The decommissioning of nuclear facilities is a critical environmental and safety undertaking. Sohn and Hong’s (2021) article presents a robust simulation study using the Sign test and Wilcoxon Rank Sum (WRS) test, for assessing the cleanliness of nuclear decommissioning sites. Sohn and Hong (2021) explore the ”MARSSIM” approach, which provides a structured methodology using non-parametric statistical tests for final status surveys of the nuclear sites that determine whether a given site is clean. They use a Monte Carlo simulation so they can experiment on a wide range of site-specific scenarios.
This project aims to reproduce and validate their findings through a simulation study and verify the statistical analysis conducted. Additionally, it explores parametric alternatives, comparing their applicability and effectiveness against the original non-parametric approach. First, we will discuss the MARRSIM approach and dissect the methodology to simulate hypothetical surveys of radioactive sites.
